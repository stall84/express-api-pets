--A simple, student-educational based API that stores, updates, and displays owners of pets, and their specific pets information.  A bit more work involved in that the objects are more complex/nested.

--Eventually want to wire up a webpage interface for communicating with the Express built back-end which is the only part of the initial package.

-- nodemon is listed in dependencies but is not necessary for the final package.
